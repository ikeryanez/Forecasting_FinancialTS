# Forecasting financial time series using statistical models and machine learning algorithms

This project, conducted by Iker Ya√±ez Calderon and Alberto Tapia Rubio for the master's thesis in Big Data Science at Universidad de Navarra, aims to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis between statistical models and machine learning techniques for forecasting financial time series. The goal is to identify and evaluate the relative performance of both approaches, ultimately determining which proves to be more effective in accurately predicting market movements.
